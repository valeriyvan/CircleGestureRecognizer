Example iOS app demonstrating how Circle Gesture Recogniser is working.
All credets go to [Jeff Lamarche](http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.com/2009/04/detecting-circle-gesture.html). I just modified code to work with StoreBoard instaed of xibs and added code to help understand/show how algorith is working.
